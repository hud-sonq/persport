        <h1>Accountonomics</h1>
        <p style="margin: 2%;">- Accountonomics is a team-based educational webgame that puts students in charge of a business, and their decisions drive results in a simulated competitive market. They are responsible for accounting for their actions.</p>
        <p style="margin: 2%;">- This is my current project of focus. I am responsible for improving and maintaining the frontend.</p>
        <p style="margin: 2%;">- Most of the project's code was developed in 2020; in early 2023, I began to assist with devlopment by adding a glossary center, a dark mode, a working journal entry component, and several general ui/ux improvements.</p>
        <p style="margin: 2%; border-bottom: 4px solid var(--ui-primary); padding-bottom: 12px;">- Our team hopes to release this game to the public by Q4 2024.</p>
